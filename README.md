# SCAI7-Computer-Vision-and-Natural-Language-Processing✨
This project explores the application of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques in the MSIB program, AI Track, at Startup Campus. The tasks include:

### 🖼️`Computer Vision - Digital Image Processing`: 
Replicating Apple and Samsung’s photo enhancement technology to brighten dark images and comparing the results with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE).
### 🔄`Computer Vision - Transfer Learning with Pre-trained CNN`: 
Using Transfer Learning to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset by adapting pre-trained models such as DenseNet, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and testing model performance.
### 🎞️`Computer Vision - Real-time Object Detection`: 
Testing the accuracy of YOLOv5 for real-time object detection on three provided YouTube URLs.
### 👁️‍🗨️`Natural Language Processing - Text Classification`: 
Implementing a BERT-based model to classify disaster-related tweets, aiding in the analysis of public responses to emergencies and supporting disaster response efforts.
